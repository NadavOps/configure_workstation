MAC additional software to consider:

    * rectangle (https://rectanglemac.app/) (suggested)
    * swish
* API client
    * insomnia
    * postman
    * rapidapi (free for personal use)


MAC soft configuration: (not programatic right now)
* keyboard:
    * key repeat rate (fastest)
    * delay until repeat (shortest)
    * enable "f" keys as standard function keys
        * keyboard -> key shortcuts -> function keys -> toggle the option "use f1, f2, etc. keys as standard keys"
    * disable smart quotes and dashes
        * keyboard -> input sources -> "use smart quotes and dashes"

Other:
